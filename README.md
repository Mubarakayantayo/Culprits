## LLM-Integrated Honeypot for Intelligent Threat Deception

This project implements an AI-powered honeypot using the Beelzebub framework with LLM integration to simulate a real Linux system and deceive attackers.

The system captures attacker behavior, commands, and exploit attempts and visualizes activity using the ELK Stack.

### Team
- Mubarak Ayantayo
- Jack Wehberg

### Project Type
Combination — 3-page research paper and software

### Tools
- Beelzebub  
- T-Pot  
- Docker  
- Azure VM  
- ELK Stack  
- GPT-4o / Ollama  

### Goal
Improve honeypot effectiveness by replacing static responses with LLM-generated interaction to increase attacker engagement and data quality.
