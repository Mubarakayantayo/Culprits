## 1 *LLM-Integrated Honeypot for Intelligent Threat Deception*

> **Objective:** Build a next-generation cyber deception system using AI-powered automation and realistic system emulation.

This project aims to deploy `Beelzebub`, an advanced AI-driven honeypot framework, to build a **high-interaction deception environment** capable of mimicking a real Linux system.

By integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) such as `GPT-4o`, the honeypot will dynamically:

- Simulate realistic **terminal responses**
- Emulate **human-like behavior**
- Adapt to attacker input patterns in real time

### System Features

- `LLM-powered command responses`
- `Realistic system state emulation`
- `Captured exploit attempts`
- `Full attacker session logging`
- `Prompt-injection detection`
- `Behavioral analytics engine`

### Monitoring & Infrastructure

The system will be:

- Containerized via `Docker`
- Deployed inside an **isolated virtual machine (VM)**
- Observed using an `ELK stack dashboard` for real-time telemetry

### Expected Outcomes

- Live intrusion logs
- Adversarial behavior insights
- AI-driven deception validation
- Automated attacker classification
- Contributions to **cyber-deception research** and **threat intelligence**

## 2 Malware Classification Using Transformers

> **Objective:** Explore AI-powered malware detection using modern neural architectures.

This project focuses on building a malware classification system using **transformer-based deep learning models**.

### Topics Covered

- What malware is
- Historical malware evolution
- Impact on systems & infrastructure
- Analysis of **open-source malware commits**
- Detection of **possibly injected exploits**

### ML Pipeline

I will experiment with:

- `HuggingFace transformer models`
- File-based static malware classification

If performance is poor, I will fall back to:

- `RandomForest` as a baseline model

### Demo App

I will build a **small full-stack demo** with:

- API-based file classification
- Simple UI (vibe-coded frontend)
- Reuse of skeleton code from previous projects
- Local file upload & detection results

Goal: *Make it work well enough to demonstrate feasibility — not perfection.*

## 3️⃣ Paper on DDoS Attacks *(Low Interest — Assignment Only)*

> Minimal effort project for requirement completion.

- Just writing the paper
- No system implementation planned
- Fulfills class requirement only

## Final Note

Primary focus will be on **Project 1** and **Project 2**.  
Project 3 exists only to *SATISFY 3 proposals submission*.
